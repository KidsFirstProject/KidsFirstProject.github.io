I wasn’t really great or confident in myself talking with people or to people about my story until Antoinette came in and changed my whole perspective. She made me go over it three or four times in front of people at the workshop and if I wasn’t quite confident enough to her, she would say to me that I have to sit up straight and read my favorite line as loud and proud as I can. She was just an amazing person. I really enjoyed her and her visit! '

But I think meeting Wyden was amazing for me, personally. I told him my story and how I’m still homeless to this day, and I had nowhere to go when I got back into Portland. He showed a lot of concern. He told me that he wanted all of my contact information and that he was going to, under promise, ensure that I was going to have a place to go back when I got home, and I did! '

We also had Georgetown Cupcakes which was amazing! We also went to the famous Founding Farmers in DC and their food was so good!'
