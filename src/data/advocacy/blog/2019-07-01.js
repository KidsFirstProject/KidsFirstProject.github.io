        "I'm really thankful that I got the opportunity to have a platform in which I could promote change in my community. Throughout this trip I have made a series of observations and have met some wonderful people! I've learned so much throughout the past week and I'm excited for what is to come. On this trip we got the privilege of meeting with Senator Jeff Merkely and Senator Ron Wyden, which were for the most part, very friendly and open to hearing each of our stories. As well as Commisioner, Jo Ann Hardesty. Jo Ann was very outgoing and a very genuine neighbor, in fact we were on the same flight home with her! I hope that some of our stories caught their attention and had an impact on them, so that they can help us make change. On the first night of our trip, the fellows and I got to walk around Chinatown and see the White House for the first time. In all honesty, it was underwhelming, I can see that the media does a great job of enlarging it because it was really small compared to other beautiful historical structures. Some of my favorites from the trip were the U.S. Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and the Union Station. On my second night in D.C. I met Michele Mahoney, a director of membership and marketing who worked for the National Guard Museum. Michele showed me around Union Station and showed me the reality of homelessness in D.C., a lot of the homeless citizens are constantly pushed away from the city areas and living under bridges or under the Metro areas. A lot of apartment constructions could be seen from our Airbnb yet a lot can't afford to live in them and according to Michele, apartment prices are sometimes double the price of Portland's average rent rate. I'm really glad I met Michele she was a very kind enough to give me a short tour around D.C., while doing her daily walk. I'm also glad I was able to meet and build a good relationship with the other leadership fellows along this trip, their stories were resilient and I really enjoyed getting to know them. On our last day we enjoyed a tour of all the Historical Monuments, starting from the Washington Monument. We had a couple of hours to spare before our flight back home and we took this time to observe the Free Iran Protest. The fellows and I really took a lot of insight from this and learned more about the tensions between our country and Iran. The last couple of days I felt a little homesick, I think Portland for me will always be home and it will always be where I feel most comfortable but I learned so much from being in a different environment, which I truly enjoyed. Overall the best thing for me from this advocacy program was meeting all the people I've had the opportunity to meet. I truly appreciate the fellows I've gotten to know, and the Kids First Project leaders, Alisha, Malcom and Brian. It was such a pleasure meeting all the workshop speakers as well, that helped us prepare for our trip, Antoinette Edwards really inspired me with her powerful words of wisdom, she speaks not only for herself but for others in a way no one else can and I really admire that. She gave us the opportunity to have a platform and attend a Community Peace Collaborative in North Portland. From there I also gained connections with other Portland youth programs and Angela Donley, a Social worker and Policy Director, who I plan on meeting up for some coffee and ask her questions in regards to my major. The Equal Access to Roads act has passed the House and Senate and now just needs to be by Governor Kate Brown! I was so excited to hear the good news while back in Portland. This will allow all citizens, regardless of citizenship status, to be able to obtain a driver's license. This is a huge impact that will provide some safety for immigrants when commuting. Thank you Kids First for providing me with such an amazing and life changing opportunity, I'm excited to see what will come from this and I'm ready to get more involved in my home, Portland ,Oregon."
