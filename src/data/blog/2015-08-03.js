    'As summer comes to an end, it’s hard not to look back and reflect on all the new friends and memories created. Through the endless images of soccer on the beach, a tent pitched on top of an ant hill, and hauling stacks of books to the coffee shop, one picture stands out the most: a room of fifty rising changemakers surrounded by driven women leaders.',

        'The ANNpower Vital Voices Initiative is a groundbreaking partnership between Ann Taylor and Vital Voices: “We are working together to empower young women from across the U.S. with the leadership skills they need to affect global progress, invest in their communities and begin their journeys as the next generation of leaders”. In April, back when Kids First Project was simply a mission dreamt by Lincoln’s Hope For Homeless Club, I found out I had been selected as one of fifty girls from around the world to attend the leadership conference in Washington D.C. in June as an ANNpower Fellow.'

If I were to write my entire experience, it would be more of a novel than a blog post, so I have compiled my top ten memories and lessons learned from the conference to share and hopefully inspire as much as it inspired me.'

        'Because of ANNpower, I was equipped with the knowledge and inspiration needed to establish Kids First Project and register as a 501c3 nonprofit in one short month. Without Patty’s powerful boa, Kay Krill’s ten life lessons, the bravery of all the Vital Voices Global Leadership awardees, my mentor Priti Patkar, all forty nine changemakers, and many others, Kids First Project would not have been possible. I look forward to utilizing the ANNpower Network for years to come and will encourage any girl who looks to change the world to take advantage of this amazing opportunity.'
