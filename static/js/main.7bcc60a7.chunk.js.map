Throughout this trip I have made a series of observations and have met some wonderful people! I've learned so much throughout the past week and I'm excited for what is to come. On this trip we got the privilege of meeting with Senator Jeff Merkely and Senator Ron Wyden, which were for the most part, very friendly and open to hearing each of our stories. As well as Commisioner, Jo Ann Hardesty. Jo Ann was very outgoing and a very genuine neighbor, in fact we were on the same flight home with her! I hope that some of our stories caught their attention and had an impact on them, so that they can help us make change. On the first night of our trip, the fellows and I got to walk around Chinatown and see the White House for the first time. In all honesty, it was underwhelming, I can see that the media does a great job of enlarging it because it was really small compared to other beautiful historical structures. Some of my favorites from the trip were the U.S. Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and the Union Station. On my second night in D.C. I met Michele Mahoney, a director of membership and marketing who worked for the National Guard Museum. Michele showed me around Union Station and showed me the reality of homelessness in D.C., a lot of the homeless citizens are constantly pushed away from the city areas and living under bridges or under the Metro areas. A lot of apartment constructions could be seen from our Airbnb yet a lot can't afford to live in them and according to Michele, apartment prices are sometimes double the price of Portland's average rent rate. I'm really glad I met Michele she was a very kind enough to give me a short tour around D.C., while doing her daily walk. I'm also glad I was able to meet and build a good relationship with the other leadership fellows along this trip, their stories were resilient and I really enjoyed getting to know them. On our last day we enjoyed a tour of all the Historical Monuments, starting from the Washington Monument. We had a couple of hours to spare before our flight back home and we took this time to observe the Free Iran Protest. The fellows and I really took a lot of insight from this and learned more about the tensions between our country and Iran. The last couple of days I felt a little homesick, I think Portland for me will always be home and it will always be where I feel most comfortable but I learned so much from being in a different environment, which I truly enjoyed. Overall the best thing for me from this advocacy program was meeting all the people I've had the opportunity to meet. I truly appreciate the fellows I've gotten to know, and the Kids First Project leaders, Alisha, Malcom and Brian. It was such a pleasure meeting all the workshop speakers as well, that helped us prepare for our trip, Antoinette Edwards really inspired me with her powerful words of wisdom, she speaks not only for herself but for others in a way no one else can and I really admire that. She gave us the opportunity to have a platform and attend a Community Peace Collaborative in North Portland. From there I also gained connections with other Portland youth programs and Angela Donley, a Social worker and Policy Director, who I plan on meeting up for some coffee and ask her questions in regards to my major. The Equal Access to Roads act has passed the House and Senate and now just needs to be by Governor Kate Brown! I was so excited to hear the good news while back in Portland. This will allow all citizens, regardless of citizenship status, to be able to obtain a driver's license. This is a huge impact that will provide some safety for immigrants when commuting. Thank you Kids First for providing me with such an amazing and life changing opportunity, I'm excited to see what will come from this and I'm ready to get more involved in my home, Portland ,Oregon.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'divider'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'author',\r\n      name: 'Norena Arias',\r\n      title: '2019 Fellow'\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default AdvocacyBlog20190701;\r\n","const AdvocacyBlog20190628 = {\r\n  id: 20190628,\r\n  title: \"Baylee's Post D.C.

At Senator Wyden’s office we shared our stories as well as asked lots of questions about what we were looking for in our pitches. Our last meeting that day was with The National Law Center on Homlessness and Poverty, where we learned about what they did and the change they’re inspiring. After that we had a celebratory dinner at founding fathers and had GeorgeTown Cupcakes for dessert. Knowing it was our last day even though we were exhausted me and another fellow went out on one last adventure to take in the city and found beautiful buildings and monuments. She also got to hold her first firefly. '\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'On our last day we did a tour of the monument mall.

The main occupations who deal with people in addiction are homeless shelters, fast food workers, and mental health facilities. If these places receive better understanding for addiction, it would make it easier to help those struggling to obtain accurate and efficient help to not only get them sober, but to keep them sober. The problem with incarceration as a solution for drug related crimes is that, yes, it forces those to detox and be sober the time they are locked up, but it doesn't give support to keep them sober. It actually does the opposite, and drives those to want to use that much more due to the trauma that is jail. If instead of locking up a human for three years due to possession of heroin, we should in turn have them take a six month long recovery program so they not only get sober, but also learn the skills they need to stay sober.

Back home, our fellows have continued their\r\n          advocacy both in Portland and Salem.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </Col>\r\n      <Col>\r\n        <h2>Summer Advocacy Blog</h2>\r\n        {recentPosts.map(({ title, publishDate, type, id }) => (\r\n          <Media key={`media-object-${id}`}>\r\n            <FontAwesomeIcon icon={iconMap[type]} size=\"4x\" color=\"#60CCCC\" />\r\n            <Media.Body>\r\n              <Container>\r\n                <Link to={`advocacy/blog/post/${id}`}>\r\n                  <h5>{title}</h5>\r\n                </Link>\r\n                <p>{dayjs(publishDate).format('MMM Do YYYY')}</p>\r\n              </Container>\r\n            </Media.Body>\r\n          </Media>\r\n        ))}\r\n        <LinkContainer\r\n          exact\r\n          to=\"/advocacy/blog\"\r\n          className=\"d-flex justify-content-center\"\r\n        >\r\n          <Button variant=\"primary\">Read More</Button>\r\n        </LinkContainer>\r\n      </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <Row>\r\n      <Col>\r\n        <h2>2019 Fellows</h2>\r\n      </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <Row>\r\n      {fellows2019.map((fellow, index) => (\r\n        <FellowCard fellow={fellow} key={`fellow-${index}`} />\r\n      ))}\r\n    </Row>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <Row>\r\n      <Col>\r\n        <h2>Gallery</h2>\r\n      </Col>\r\n    </Row>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <Row>\r\n      <Gallery />\r\n    </Row>\r\n  </Container>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default AdvocacyPage;\r\n","import headerImage from '../../assets/images/blog/2015-08-03-01.jpg';\r\nimport image1 from '../../assets/images/blog/2015-08-03-02.jpg';\r\nimport image2 from '../../assets/images/blog/2015-08-03-03.jpg';\r\nimport image3 from '../../assets/images/blog/2015-08-03-04.jpg';\r\n\r\nconst Blog20150803 = {\r\n  id: 20150803,\r\n  title: '2015 ANNpower Leadership Conference: The Catalyst Behind Kids First',\r\n  type: 'text',\r\n  publishDate: '2015-08-03',\r\n  headerImage,\r\n  summary:\r\n    'As summer comes to an end, it’s hard not to look back and reflect on all the new friends and memories created.

It focuses on the hours or costs involved in specific units of production and treats each trial, or set, as a separate reference point. The theory states that people can learn to do things more efficiently when performing repetitive tasks. The more subsequent iterations there are, the more efficient the person becomes at completing said task.

While it doesn’t necessarily invalidate the arguments as discussed in the beginning of this paper, it offers some evidence that the ability to learn, at least among the children at this stage of their development, no matter what their economic standpoint is, is the same. In high school, a child’s socioeconomic status may have a more pronounced effect on their development, as their brain is nearly fully developed by then, therefore affecting their overall ability to learn. To me this finding is very significant as children with an economic disadvantage are entitled to the same dream as everyone else as they have the ability to become a scientist, a social justice advocate, a teacher, or even a future President. Unfortunately, because of the implications of poverty, those children do not have access to many of the social resources that the rest of society does. Their learning capacity is unmitigatedly suppressed. This is reflected in the memory capacity data that showed that Forest Park students were able to memorize more words on average compared to Whitman students, despite having the same learning rate. For accumulated number of words for all participants, Forest Park students memorized 38% more than Whitman students.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'The above discussion is crucial to the educational sector in the following three aspects. One is that decision makers should respect that all children have an equal capacity, as seen through the near equal average learning rates between Forest Park and Whitman students, and right to learn. Treating children living in poverty as if they have a ‘learning’ disability is not a constructive method and excuse for not allocating insufficient resources. Second, the theory cited in the US News article could still hold true if the children under poverty continue to suffer from inadequate learning environment and result in brains not being fully developed when they grow into their adolescent years. Lastly, politicians are shortsighted to ignore such a problem that is affecting so many young people. The impact of ignorance towards educational disparities will in turn translate into a disproportionate waste of social resources, where money is being allocated towards ineffective solutions meant to break the generational cycle of poverty.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'Although the results provide more insights to childhood development, especially those in poverty, there were potential errors and setbacks involved that may have skewed the data.

Despite our best efforts to prevent cheating, there may have been cheating in some form when the trials were being conducted. Finally I had not considered that some children could have memorized many words at first, but then memorized fewer later on. Little errors like these can create a skew that can potentially adjust the outcome to be very different from reality. Fortunately the standard deviation of the data was relatively low, between 1.90 and 3.12, so even if there were a couple of outliers their impact was not very large on the overall picture.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'If I were to expand on this experiment, I would try the same exercise on different age ranges.

Outside of having a lack of educational resources, poverty may also negatively affect a child’s academics through other factors, like a lack of nutrition, time, and external stress, further staggering development and preventing them from being able to succeed in school.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'In conclusion, I think it is safe to say for now that based on the data acquired, poverty negatively affects child development.

Emphasizing the importance of both educational and recreational activities, these affordable and convenient programs for children to participate in after school would assist in their development and mental health. Skills such as reading and critical thinking are crucial in the development of youth starting from a very young age. By continuing to emphasize the importance of classroom curriculum and core subjects but adding in additional educational and recreational resources, we should see improvements in children’s memory and cognitive abilities.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'That is exactly the reason I found Kids First Project, a nonprofit organization that has a mission to promote HOPE - Health, Opportunity, Play, Education.

I have often heard wealth redistribution and steeper taxes on the rich proposed as potential solutions to the problem. Absent a plan for strategic investment of these dollars, I see no solution to wealth inequality. Investment in educational equality, however, will address the cycle of poverty. I work on the administrative team of a youth volunteer organization called Kids First Project whose mission is to help end the cycle of poverty by providing opportunities to allow homeless youth to reach their full potential. In working with youth in shelter, I have noticed that their socioeconomic status severely limits their educational opportunities. Beginning before kindergarten, the educational system is stacked against youth in poverty. They attend poorly performing schools with low graduation rates and high dropout rates. They don’t have the same resources and support in elementary, middle, or high school. Most of the youth I have talked with look to obtain a high school GED before continuing straight into the workforce. Without a complete education or college degree, getting a secure, higher paying job is challenging, making the cycle of poverty inescapable and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'Every person deserves the opportunity to succeed, regardless of socioeconomic status.

We need to improve schools in impoverished areas, create better support systems in all schools, and implement safety nets for at risk students earlier on to give every child the opportunity to receive the education they need to be successful. Providing educational equality offers an opportunity to escape the generational cycle of poverty and allows for upward mobility. Ultimately, solving these interrelated issues will benefit all Americans, because higher levels of education and wealth are correlated to lower rates of other social issues, such as violent crime, teenage pregnancies, and drug abuse. If we can solve these issues, we can stop the crippling cycle of poverty, make the American Dream attainable, create a more unified country and pave the way to social change worldwide.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'divider'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'author',\r\n      name: 'Rebecca Reynolds',\r\n      title: 'Operations Director of Kids First Project'\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Blog20160920;\r\n","const Blog20170113 = {\r\n  id: 20170113,\r\n  title: 'Student Work from Poeteen’s Poetry Workshops',\r\n  type: 'text',\r\n  publishDate: '2017-01-13',\r\n  summary:\r\n    'Poetry created by youth staying at New Avenues for Youth, compiled by Sophia Mautz, one of our Volunteer Leaders.',\r\n  body: [\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'heading',\r\n      text: 'Poem 1'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text: 'Ask yourself: how do you know what you know?'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'How do you know about the moss that clings to the sea-sprayed rock?'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'Did it whisper its story to you as you brushed your fingers through its soft beds of hair?'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'divider'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'heading',\r\n      text: 'Poem 2'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text: 'He saw her on a Monday morning'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text: 'Olive skin, olive hair, and olive eyes'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text: 'She had been plucked from a branch of rough, cracked bark'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text: 'Cloaked in slender leaves.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'divider'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'heading',\r\n      text: 'Poem 3'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text: 'All my life so far, I have loved more than one thing.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'When I was a field hand in Shanghai I loved licking the dried salt off my fingers at the end of the day.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text: 'When I was a grave digger I loved the smell of fresh snow.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'When I was the wind I loved the trees, and when I was a tree I loved the wind.'\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Blog20170113;\r\n","import headerImage from '../../assets/images/blog/2017-01-15.png';\r\n\r\nconst Blog20170115 = {\r\n  id: 20170115,\r\n  title: 'Volunteer Spotlight of the Month: Jackie Zhang',\r\n  type: 'interview',\r\n  publishDate: '2017-01-15',\r\n  headerImage,\r\n  summary:\r\n    'A current sophomore at Sunset High School, Jackie is our first Volunteer of the Month!

As Kids First’s platform grew, my team created a blog that allows us to write about issues related to our work, whether it’s critiquing America’s educational system or sharing with our readers the concept of intersectional human rights, as well as to provide a platform for the youth we serve to publish their poetry and other writing.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      type: 'paragraph',\r\n      text:\r\n        'Because of the power of technology, youth voices are able to be heard beyond our communities, reaching individuals and groups all around the world.

Another consideration is that by only listening to those who are already involved in the work of the UN and related areas, we are turning a blind eye to youth who do not have such a platform.
