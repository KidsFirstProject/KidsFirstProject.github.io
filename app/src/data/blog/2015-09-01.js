The Kids First Project provides an opportunity for youth experiencing homeless to exit from that brutal cycle that\'s very hard to escape. Providing opportunity, raising awareness, and valuable educational experiences are the tools to escape generational poverty, which is what the Kids First Project strives for.'

      text: 'The experience of working with families experiencing homelessness has been incredibly eye-opening. My favorite memory is when I first began working for PHFS. I was in an operational role, and didn\'t have much interaction with the families at this point. I was at the office by myself, and a family who had just been approved for housing came by to pick up their things. After connecting with leadership staff, I took the family downstairs at the Goose to collect their belongings. The entire time, the father of the family could not stop thanking me for the services that PHFS has provided them, what positive influences that the staff and volunteers provided them, and just how grateful he was to finally have a house for him, his wife, and his 2-year-old daughter. That was the first time I really got to see the impact that the program has on our guests, and how much of an impact that a "small" community can have on someone.'
