      text: 'For the past two years, I have been involved at Turning Point, which is a transitional housing organization for families with kids. The STEM programs I have led there include making mini-catapults, stimulating an egg drop activity, and making candy cars. Because most of the kids there are toddlers, I sometimes divert my focus on science related activities and instead hold fun activities such as finger painting, creating holiday cards, and making clay sculptures. We also have had guest speakers come in to talk with the kids. Recently, three Lincoln High School students presented on the topic of culture and language for their CAS project.'
