However, I wanted an opportunity to work more directly with people, rather than just animals. After doing some research, Kids First Project seemed like the ideal option, as I have had a lot of babysitting experience and enjoy spending time with kids. I was immediately welcomed into the KFP community, and I feel very lucky to be a part of it!'

      text: 'During my first KFP program night, we taught the kids how to construct catapults out of popsicle sticks, with the help of an informative blog post. It was incredibly heartwarming to witness the genuine excitement of all of the children, upon seeing the catapults that we had built together launch the colorful pom poms into the air. It was not just funâ€” it was also an unexpected learning experience for all of us, because we ran a number of trials to determine which launch techniques worked best, height-wise and distance-wise.'

If I had a day to do whatever I wanted, I would go pick up two of my closest friends, Libby and Lea, and drive us all out to the Columbia River Gorge. On our way there, we would jam out, by listening to my Spotify road trip playlist. We would then spend the entire day going from trail to trail, exploring the countless waterfalls, and taking pictures to document our adventures.'
