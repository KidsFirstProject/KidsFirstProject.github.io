  summary: 'Recently, we received a generous donation of five hundred dollars from Joan and John Bollier, both of whom are new volunteers at PHFS, to purchase back-to-school supplies for the kids in shelter. Knowing how empowering and exciting it is to start the school year off with a new backpack, shining school supplies, and outfit, our team quickly set out to gather all the families wishlists.',

After writing personalized cards and filling each backpack to the zipper with each child’s wish list items, a few of us were able to head out the same night to deliver the backpacks. Words cannot describe how joyful and appreciative the children were - It could definitely be compared to Christmas morning.'
